		<h1>Welcome to HTML/CSS session </h1>
		<p>
			The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
			for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
			technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
			JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
			and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
			of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
			the document.
